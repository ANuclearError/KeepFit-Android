\subsection{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sub:implementation_5}
The implementation of this stage was doing using the Preferences support library
(v7 and v14 were used). Again, the \emph{DateDialogPreference} was used for
handling the setting of dates. The main problem in this stage was that the
\emph{EditTextPreference} in this support library removed access to the
\emph{EditText} object, meaning that the user could not be prevented from
entering ant string into the preference. A \emph{ListView} or \emph{Spinner} may
have been a more appropriate option here.

 The \emph{SharedPreferencesRepository}
handles this resorting to the default value when the string cannot be parsed to
a double.

The goal and date filters are enums, and Java 8 streams are used to handle the
filtering when the \emph{HistoryPresenter} passes the history onto the view. The
database has no knowledge of these filters.

It was decided that even if the current filter does not need them, the
preferences for the custom date range and goals above or below a certain value
were left enabled due to there being no harm in being changed during these
other filters.
