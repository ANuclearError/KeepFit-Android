\subsection{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sub:implementation_7}
The Preferences were implemented using the Preferences support libraries, v7 and
v14. The preferences were split into categories based on their functionality,
for example Test Mode is its own category.

The preferences do not require confirmation before clearing history, although it
should.

In order to make accessing the preferences elsewhere in the application, a
\emph{PreferencesRepoistory} interface was defined, which is implemented by
\emph{SharedPreferencesRepository}, which enables static retrieval of the
preferences.
