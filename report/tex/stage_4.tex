To incorporate different units, the \emph{Unit} enum was added, with the
abbreviation names of the measurements included to override the enum's 
\emph{toString} method. The \emph{UnitsConverter} class has the responsibility
of handling the conversion between units, which is accessed statically by other
classes.

The user is able to enter steps in any measurement, which is converted
internally while maintaining the user's original input.
